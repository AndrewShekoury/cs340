## Background
I am a junior CS major from Marietta, GA. Back home, I am the youngest of 3 kids and have a dog named Milo. Here on campus, I am a Co-Director for Hack4Impact UTK, a web development student org that creates software solutions for nonprofits to both introduce students to web dev principles that are not taught in the CS curriculum and to give back to the local Knoxville community. I grew up playing soccer and still enjoy watching Premier League and MLS games every weekend.
