# Hi!

My name is Jacob Yuill and I'm a junior CS major. My GitHub username is simply my first and last name, `jacobyuill`. My UTK netid is `jtyuill`, with the `t` being my middle initial.

My hometown is Hendersonville, TN, which is about 10 minutes north of Nashville. A lot of famous musicians have called Hendersonville home at some point in their lives, with the most famous being Taylor Swift and Johnny Cash. 

I've always enjoyed using and learning about computers, having learned to read on one when I was a kid. Linux is my favorite thing in the world even including everything not computing related. I hope to work somewhere in the intersection of Linux and software engineering, such as a DevOps job, but I would still be more than happy with a plain sysadmin job. [Here is a link](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/incorrect-quotation.en.html) to one of my favorite Richard Stallman posts that I find to be unintentionally hilarious.
