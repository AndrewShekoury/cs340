# Ryan Wolpert - Assignment 1 #

My name is Ryan Wolpert. My NetID is rwolpert and my Github username is rwolpert8. I am a senior Computer Science major at UT. I have been programming for 4 years; I started learning Python via online courses before I started at UT, and have since learned more and more languages, toolkits, and frameworks. Here is a list of packages I am familiar with: 
* Python
    - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, PyTorch, NLTK
* Java
* C++
* C
* HTML/CSS
* Typescript
* React

As far as my interests go, computers have always been my biggest interest, but I also enjoy working out, cooking, and watching a lot of sports. I am looking forward to this class, and I hope to gain knowledge on software engineering practices, version control, industry standards, and the opportunity to work on a cool project.
